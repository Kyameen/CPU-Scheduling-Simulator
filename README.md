# CPU-Scheduling-Simulator
This project implements multiple CPU scheduling algorithms, including FCFS, SJF (preemptive &amp; non-preemptive), Priority (preemptive &amp; non-preemptive), and Round Robin. It reads process data from a file, simulates execution, and outputs waiting times and averages. Developed in C++ with linked lists for process management and runs on a Linux server.
